# Goal
Transition dynamic content rendering from PHP to static HTML in `index.html` and create a new `contact.html` page.

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Migrate Menu Data to `index.html` → Verify: Menu renders correctly without PHP fetch.
- [ ] Task 2: Migrate FAQ Data to `index.html` → Verify: FAQ accordions function properly.
- [ ] Task 3: Migrate Events Data to `index.html` → Verify: Events list displays and map markers sync.
- [ ] Task 4: Migrate Reviews Data to `index.html` → Verify: Review cards display correctly.
- [ ] Task 5: Clean up `main.js` and delete PHP files (except `booking-handler.php`) → Verify: No console errors for missing fetch endpoints.
- [ ] Task 6: Create `contact.html` with layout (Info + Map side-by-side, Form below) → Verify: Page matches aesthetic and is responsive.
- [ ] Task 7: Update references to booking in `index.html` to point to `contact.html` → Verify: CTAs navigate to new page.

## Done When
- [ ] All PHP data fetching is removed from frontend.
- [ ] `index.html` has hardcoded content for menu, faq, events, and reviews.
- [ ] `contact.html` is fully functional with styling consistent with `index.html`.
- [ ] `checklist.py` passes or manual UX check is solid.
